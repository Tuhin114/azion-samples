# Jekyll Boilerplate

The **Jekyll Boilerplate** accelerates the deployment of a basic Jekyll project, directly on the edge of the network.

This template deploys a repository with a project based on Jekyll, a framework written in **Ruby**, that enables you to create static sites using Markdown and HTML files. 

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template via Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM), check the [How to deploy the Jekyll Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/jekyll-boilerplate/) guide.

This template uses Jekyll version `4.3.3`.
