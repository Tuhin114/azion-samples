# VitePress Typescript Boilerplate

The **VitePress Typescript Boilerplate** allows you to deploy a static project on the edge quickly and easily. VitePress, a static site generator built on top of Vite and Vue.js, is ideal for creating documentation websites with features including a markdown-based content system, a built-in theming system, and fast hot module replacement.

This template, written in *Typescript*, creates a GitHub repository containing your project, as well as an edge application and a domain to facilitate your access and management through Azion Edge Platform.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the VitePress Typescript Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/vitepress-typescript-boilerplate/) guide.

VitePress Typescript Boilerplate uses VitePress version `1.3.0`.
