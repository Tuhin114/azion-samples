# Next.js Pages + Configurations 

The **Next.js Pages + Configurations** template enables you to quickly deploy a Next.js application with Pages Router and custom configurations This template deploys a basic Next.js application containing a domain to access the Single-Page Application (SPA), an [Edge Storage configuration](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/), cache settings, Gzip compression, and Rules Engine rules to improve the performance and delivery of static files. Additionally, it creates a new GitHub repository, including a GitHub Action to enable a continuous development workflow and keep your application up to date.

**Next.js Pages + Configurations** also creates files to implement the [Pages Router format](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages), to use a file-system router to map each file to a route.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment.
