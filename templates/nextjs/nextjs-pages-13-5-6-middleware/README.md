# Next.js Pages + Middleware 

The **Next.js Pages + Middleware** template enables you to quickly deploy a Next.js application with Pages Router, a middleware, and custom configurations. This template deploys a basic Next.js application containing a domain to access the Single-Page Application (SPA), an [Edge Storage configuration](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/), cache settings, Gzip compression, and Rules Engine rules to improve the performance and delivery of static files. Additionally, it creates a new GitHub repository, including a GitHub Action to enable a continuous development workflow and keep your application up to date.
 
**Next.js Pages + Middleware** also creates files to implement the [Pages Router format](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages), to use a file-system router to map each file to a route. It also includes a [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) that allows you to modify the response for a request and control different aspects of the application, such as performing redirects, setting headers, and others.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the Next.js Pages + Middleware template](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/nextjs-pages-middleware/) guide.

This template uses Next version `13.5.6`.
