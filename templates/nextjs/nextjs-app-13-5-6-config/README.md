# Next.js App + Configurations

The **Next.js App + Configurations** template provides a quick start to build a Next.js application with custom configurations and App Router to run it directly on the edge.

This template deploys a basic Next.js application containing a domain to access the Single-Page Application (SPA), as well as an [Edge Storage configuration](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/), cache settings, Gzip compression, and Rules Engine rules to improve the performance and delivery of static files. Additionally, it creates a new GitHub repository, including a GitHub Action to enable a continuous development workflow and keep your application up to date.

Next.js App + Configurations also creates files to implement the [App Router format](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), including the index page, edge API routing, and Custom Route Handlers, created in the new repository during the deployment.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the Next.js App + Configurations template](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/nextjs-app-configurations/).

This template uses Next version `13.5.6`.
