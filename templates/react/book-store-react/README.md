# Book Store React

The **Book Store React** template is based on a React web application where the users can search for a book by its title and later can add it to the shopping cart and finally purchase using a credit card transaction. It's built with ReactJS, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and uses CommerceJS and Stripe integrations for backend and payment.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment.
