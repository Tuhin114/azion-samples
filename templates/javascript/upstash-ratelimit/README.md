## Upstash Rate Limit

The **Upstash Rate Limit** template helps you to implement rate limiting in a serverless environment, without requiring extensive manual setup. This template includes configurations for limiting requests and window limit.

It works in conjunction with Azion **Edge Functions**, being possible to adjust the initial setup based on the args. Additionally, this template creates a new GitHub repository that allows a continuous deployment workflow. This way, you're able to further configure and customize further the setup to attend to your needs, obtaining easy management and delivery of your personalized content.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template, check the [How to deploy the Upstash Rate Limit template through Azion](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/upstash-rate-limiting/) guide.
