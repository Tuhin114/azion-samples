# Upstash GeoLocation

The **Upstash GeoLocation** template is an automation designed to deploy a database directly on the edge while enabling the configuration of custom messages that will be delivered according to the user's geographical location.

These messages are delivered through a static interface, based on HTML and generated by the template after deployment. 

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. The template also incorporates a file with location-based greetings, which are retrieved from the integration with Upstash. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template via Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM), check the [How to use Upstash GeoLocation through Azion](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/upstash-geolocation-edgedeploy/) guide.
