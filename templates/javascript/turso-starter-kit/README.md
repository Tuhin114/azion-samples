# Turso Starter Kit

The **Turso Starter Kit** accelerates the integration of a Turso database, created using Turso's [LibSQL SDK](https://turso.tech/libsql), into an edge function. It also provides an interface to easily create, update, and delete items in your database.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment.

This template uses LibSQL `0.5.3`.
