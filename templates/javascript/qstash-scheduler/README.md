# QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler

The **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** template is designed to set up and manage a custom edge function, which receives a user-configured schedule and dispatches it through [QStash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted), a message queue and task scheduler for serverless runtimes.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template and scheduling tasks, check the [How to use the QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler template through Azion](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/qstash-edge-function-scheduler/) guide.
