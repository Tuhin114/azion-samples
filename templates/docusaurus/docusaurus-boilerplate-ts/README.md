# Docusaurus TypeScript Boilerplate

**Docusaurus TypeScript Boilerplate** is a starter example to deploy a basic static project based on the Docusaurus framework and written in TypeScript.

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a static-site generator, building a single-page application with fast client-side navigation and leveraging React to make the site interactive. It's ideal for documentation features and other cases, including website, product pages, blog, and landing pages.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the Docusaurus TypeScript Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/docusaurus-typescript-boilerplate/) guide.

This template uses Docusaurus version `3.4.0`.
