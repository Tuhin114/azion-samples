# Astro with Multiple Frameworks

The **Astro with Multiple Frameworks** template showcases Astro's built-in support for multiple frameworks (React, Preact, Svelte, and Vue). By using this template, no configuration is needed to enable these frameworks, just start writing components in src/components.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/use-a-template-via-azion-console/).

This template uses Astro version `4.5.12`, React version `18.2.0`, Preact version `10.19.2`, Svelte version `4.2.5`, and Vue version `3.3.8`.

> **Note**: this is a community template. Third-party or external developers created it, and Azion only enables the deployment in the Azion Edge Platform. Azion doesn't provide maintenance or support for the content itself but can assist you with any queries or issues you may encounter while deploying this template or using the platform.
