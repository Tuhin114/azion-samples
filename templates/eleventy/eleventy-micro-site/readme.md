# 11ty Micro Site

The **11ty Micro Site** template facilitates the deployment of an opinionated micro front-end that can be used to create a one-pager, great for landing pages or sign-up pages. It uses the static site generator Eleventy (11ty) under the hood and sets common 11ty defaults.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/use-a-template-via-azion-console/).

This template uses Eleventy version `0.11.1`.
