# Eleventy 2 Snipcart

The **Eleventy 2 Snipcart** template deploys a simple e-commerce or catalog site, making it ideal for testing and becoming familiar with JavaScript and the Eleventy (11ty) framework. The deployment will create a new edge application with its configurations, which you can edit and manage later. It also creates a repository in your GitHub account, based on the template, allowing you to maintain control over the project.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/eleventy-ecommerce-collection/).

This template uses Eleventy version `0.5.4`.

> **Note**: this is a community template. Third-party or external developers created it, and Azion only enables the deployment in the Azion Edge Platform. Azion doesn't provide maintenance or support for the content itself but can assist you with any queries or issues you may encounter while deploying this template or using the platform.
