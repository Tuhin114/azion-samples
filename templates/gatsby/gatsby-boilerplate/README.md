# Gatsby Boilerplate

The **Gatsby Boilerplate** helps you build a Single-Page Application (SPA) based on the Gatsby framework and run it directly on the edge of the network. By executing the boilerplate, several steps are encapsulated and automated, from repository management to edge deployment.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy edge applications with the Gatsby Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/guides/gatsby-boilerplate/) guide.

The Gatsby Boilerplate uses Gatsby version `5.13.3` and React version `18.2.0`.
