# Svelte Boilerplate

The **Svelte Boilerplate** streamlines the deployment of a static application based on the Svelte framework, directly on the edge of the network, accelerating and automating the overall process.

The template deploys an edge application, a domain, and a related GitHub repository to facilitate your access and management. The repository also includes a GitHub Action to ensure a continuous deployment workflow, keeping your project up to date.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy edge applications with the Svelte Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/svelte-boilerplate/) guide.

This template uses Svelte version `4.2.7` and Vite version `5.0.3`.

## Management

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need using [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).

To manage and edit your edge applicationâ€™s settings, read the documentation about [managing edge applications](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it. Go to the [Domains](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) documentation to read more about it.
