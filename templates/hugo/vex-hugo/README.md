# Vex Hugo

The **Vex Hugo** template is a product landing page Hugo theme. It's fully responsive and crafted with Product Showcase, Testimonials, and Email Subscription sections. The deployment will create a new edge application with its configurations, which you can edit and manage later. It also creates a repository in your GitHub account, based on the template, allowing you to maintain control over the project.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy an e-commerce based on Hugo using templates](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/hugo-ecommerce-collection/) guide.

This template uses min-Hugo version `0.62.2`.

> **Note**: this is a community template. Third-party or external developers created it, and Azion only enables the deployment in the Azion Edge Platform. Azion doesn't provide maintenance or support for the content itself but can assist you with any queries or issues you may encounter while deploying this template or using the platform.
